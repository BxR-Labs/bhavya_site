I’m a PhD Candidate in Economics at Georgetown University. I work at the World Bank as a Consultant at the Africa Chief Economists’ Office, and was previously a Robert S McNamara Fellow at the Development Research Group. My work revolves around studying the effects of high temperatures and adaptation policies, particularly the sustainable and efficient use of groundwater resources in the African context. Before my PhD, I was a Research Associate at J-PAL South Asia, where I worked on a project addressing groundwater exploitation caused by the energy-water nexus in India. This experience was pivotal in helping me bridge the gap between academia and policy work.
